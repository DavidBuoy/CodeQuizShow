For this assinment I needed to create a quiz game. I have 5 questions that kind of make sence. i was tasked to have the time be the score and to go through the quiz. 

<br>

## What I did.
* I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this project. 

<br>
<br>

# Critiria for Assignment. 

* I am taking a code quiz
* I click the start button
* A timer starts and I am presented with a question
* After answering a question I am presented with another question
* I answer a question incorrectly and time should have been subtracted from the clock
* After all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over
* after the game is over I can save my initials and my score
